### Hi there 👋

I am a Robotics Engineer currently working as a System Engineer for autonomous vehicles, where I design and validate systems for perception, navigation, and control. My work focuses on turning complex robotic concepts into practical autonomy solutions deployed on real machines.

I hold both a Master’s degree in Computer Science and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Brasília. During my academic journey, I supported robotics courses as a Teaching Assistant, mentoring students and contributing to hands-on learning environments.
